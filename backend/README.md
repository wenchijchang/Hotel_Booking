## Getting Started

This backend is designed to handle all operations associated with room management, guest management, and the booking system for a hotel. The system communicates with JSON files (`rooms.json`, `guests.json`, and `bookings.json`), simulating a database for the mentioned data.

   - Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
   - An IDE of choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

2. **Installation Steps**

   git clone https://github.com/dtulpa16/Post-Grad_Coding_Assessment-Hotel_Booking.git
   
- Navigate to the backend directory.
  ```bash
  cd Post-Grad_Coding_Assessment-Hotel_Booking
- Install the required packages.
